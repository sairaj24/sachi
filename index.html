        <p class="sweet-message">
            I don’t often say this, but I truly appreciate having you as a part of my life.
            <br><br>
            Thank you for being the kind of person who quietly brings warmth, comfort, and a little extra light just by being yourself.
            <br><br>
            You deserve all the softness, happiness, and good things this year has to offer — even the ones you don’t ask for.
            <br><br>
            Stay the same real, kind, and beautifully genuine you. 💖
