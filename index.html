                **Happy Birthday, Sachu ✨**
                <br><br>
                I don’t often say this, but I truly appreciate having you as a part of my life.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for being the kind of person who quietly brings **warmth, comfort, and a little extra light** just by being yourself.
                <br><br>
                You deserve all the softness, happiness, and good things this year has to offer — even the ones you don’t ask for.
                <br><br>
                Stay the same real, kind, and beautifully genuine you. 🌼
